# PHP Native CRUD - Siswa

## üìö Project Description
This is a simple CRUD application made with PHP Native. The project helps you manage student data with basic operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It also includes a search feature and an API for data integration with other applications.

**Main Features:**
- **CRUD**: Add, view, update, and delete student data.
- **Search**: Search for student data by name or other details.
- **API**: Provides an API to fetch student data for integration.
- **Integration**: Shows how to get data from the API on another page.

This project is an archive of my learning process and personal PHP practice.
